## ToDo:

I appreciate any help, so if you want to make this project a bit better - you can check Issues of this project.

## Development:

So, if you want to participate in development - make sure that you read this part of readme. Here you can see steps to make good PR:
1. Create branch for your changes.
2. When it's done - create PR from your branch to `test` branch. After that, pipeline with Ansible script will be started, and in 10-15 minutes you can see result of your work at fs-server-test.ru:5050 . Password for this test-stand also default.
3. When you sure it works - you can create PR from test branch to main.

## Launch

### Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tre3p/home-fileserver.git file-server
cd file-server
make start-dev
```

Application will be available at 5050 port. Default username and password:

```sh
USERNAME: serv
PASSWORD: testpass
```

### Production

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tre3p/home-fileserver.git file-server
make start-prod
```

This command will pull latest version of application from Dockerhub and launch it in Docker. Username and password are default, but you can change it in docker-compose. Make sure that `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is 128 bit, because in other way, application will not work properly. You can generate one [here](https://www.allkeysgenerator.com/Random/Security-Encryption-Key-Generator.aspx)
